      <description>Vult Compacts is a new series that will contain free and paid modules. The idea behind the Compacts is to create alternate versions of the existing modules and expand/redesign the functionality. For example: the new Freak filter contains all Vult filters in a single package.
These are some of the modules that are planed for the paid version of Vult Compacts:

      <description>Included in: VultModules 
Ferox is based on the ingenious CMOS filter design. The CMOS filter uses an digital inverter chip to replace operational amplifiers. The result filter full of character, distorted and aggressive. Ferox can transform the simplest waveforms into completely new sound. In some cases it will make you doubt that it is a filter at all.

The Freak! is a collection of all the Vult filters into a single module (in stereo). The Freak! is part of the Vult Compacts package.
The Freak! has advantages and disadvantages over the individual filters. For example, it can process signals in stereo, but lacks the flexibility of having the individual inputs and outputs of the different filter modes.

      <description>The Vult modules are designed and coded by me Leonardo Laguna Ruiz. Most of the modules have been refined with ideas from very talented people of the VCV Rack community, like Alejandro Galán Álvaro. I create all these modules during my free time, driven by the passion I have for music, synthesizers, electronics and technology. These modules may not be created by a recognized software company, but they are created by a professional in area of modeling and simulation.</description>

Caudal is a chaotic source that is based on the model of a multi segment pendulum (see the video below). The core of Caudal is a detailed simulation of the pendulum system from which we can get measurements like the angular velocities and positions of the segments. These measures produces very natural oscillations that are interrelated due to the nature of the system.</description>

      <description>There are two series of modules, one simply called Vult Modules and the new Vult Compacts. Both series contain some free and some paid modules. Vult Modules (free and paid) contain over 15 high quality modules. Most of my modules are free because I believe that everybody should have access to this creations that make me happy.
The paid modules are the ones that do require more engineering and research work to develop.</description>

Flame is a simulation of three different distortion pedals and three tone circuits.
Over the years, I have build many distortion pedals based on known designs. Often times I didn&amp;rsquo;t have the exact components that the pedal required and I just used what I had. I built three different distortion circuits that I intended to use in my real eurorack and I based Flame on those three modules.</description>

Julste is the only model that I haven&amp;rsquo;t developed by myself. When I started doing research on low pass gates I came across the paper &amp;ldquo;A DIGITAL MODEL OF THE BUCHLA LOWPASS-GATE&amp;rdquo; by Julian Parker and Stefano D’Angelo. They did all the hard job modeling it, and I rewrote the code in the Vult language and created the module.
The module has a few extensions to the original model, like controls to process the gate input.</description>

Nopskate is my take on the classic flip-flop octaver pedal but adapted to VCV Rack. Given any input signal, Nopskate will generate signals that are one and two octaves below the input signal. The generated signals can be added or multiplied (AM) to the original. These two ways of blending the generated signal can transform a simple input signal into a richer wave.</description>

Noxious is a digital oscillator and LFO based on Frequency and Phase modulation techniques. The idea for Noxious was to create an oscillator that captures the crazy and experimental nature of FM and PM but at the same time making easy to obtain usable results. Noxious can create from soft and cheesy sounds to very abrasive and distorted screams. In LFO mode can create quasi-chaotic signals.</description>

Rescomb is a resonant Comb filter. A comb filter is a special kind of filter that creates multiple spaced notches. This module provides an CV input which is tuned (1V/octave) and a feedback parameter. when the feedback is high it will resonate enhancing the frequencies of the comb.
This is the first module that I designed for VCV Rack. I really like Comb filters, so I coded in Vult a very simple version after playing with it and tweaking parameters I got this version.</description>

Unstabile is &amp;ldquo;circuit bent&amp;rdquo; version of Stabile. When making Stabile I aimed to have a ver efficient and smooth filter that I could run in a small ARM processor. To achieve that I left out many things from the original circuit. With Unstabile remade the model and introduced nonlinearities that can occur when the circuit is fed with low voltage. The result is Unstabile a filter that makes everything sound big and distorted&amp;hellip; and it can self-oscillate.</description>

Vessek started modeling the basic circuit of an analog saw wave oscillator. Most of the parameters were initially obtained from my compact analog bass synth. I got a pretty good matching of the sound that I bet it would pass a blind test.
